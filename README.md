# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. 


## Installation
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Usage
To train and evaluate the model, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts provided:
   ```
   jupyter notebook fraud_detection.ipynb
   ```
   or
   ```
   python fraud_detection.py
   ```
